# Eggroll Updater

---
## What is it?

This is a basic utility that when run, downloads and extracts the latest build of [Proton-GE](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) to the correct directory for your system.
End result is that you end up with a ready to use installation, a perfect set it and forget it solution for all your Eggroll based needs.

Obviously this is intended for Linux Only, though hilariously it would technically work on Windows.

To run it, you need netcoreapp3.1 installed, AKA .Net Core 3.
